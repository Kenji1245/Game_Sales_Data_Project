# Video Games Sales Analysis and Visualisation

# Introduction
This project aims to extract meaningful insights from the video game sales data. This is done by extracting, examining, cleaning and transforming the data. The process will involve identifying patterns and relationship within dataset to gain a deeper understanding. 

# Tools used
## Programming Language
- Python
- SQL (pgAdmin 4) 

## Python libraries
- numpy
- panadas
- matplotlib
- mplcursors
- psycopg2

## Others
- Excel
- CSV

# How the tools were used
## Brief description 
The video game sales file was extracted from Kaggle as a CSV. The data was then read using code in Python and cleaned by removing rows with missing values or duplicates. Afterwards, code within Python was used to establish a connection to SQL (pg Admin 4), create an SQL table called vg_sales, and insert data into table from the CSV file. The code from Python was then used to create visualisation plots from the data from SQL, to describe patterns and relationships within the dataset with the use of matplotlib.
